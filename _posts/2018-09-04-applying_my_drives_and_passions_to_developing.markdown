I may be na√Øve, but I've always thought the internet was going to be what made people citizens of the world. 

I thought it would connect us all in ways that transcends geographical borders and the invisible barriers of language. Even in times of incredible devisiveness, the rise of fake news, and the threat of covert meddling between nations; I still believe whole-heartedly that the internet still holds the potential to connect us, increase our cultural awareness and competency, and ultimately be a tool for good instead of evil. 

It's this particular belief that I've doggedly held onto that has led me into the web development program.  I want an opportunity to help shape our virtual interactions with one another. I want to create tools and applications that bridge divides; and I want to bring a humanitarian perspect to coding and development that addresses issues like implicit bias. In a nutshell, I desire to a more egalitarian internet and I want to be part of that process.

Becoming a developer is just my first step in my next big adventure, and I'm thrilled to be able to apply my knowledge and passions in a career where I'll always be learning, growing, and making my corner of the world a better place.
